    "Q1. Purpose of grid search CV in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV (Cross-Validation) is a technique used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. Its purpose is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Systematically search through a predefined set of hyperparameter values\n",
    "2. Find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that yields the best model performance\n",
    "3. Use cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation of each combination\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "1. Define a grid of hyperparameter values to explore\n",
    "2. For each combination of hyperparameters:\n",
    "   a. Train the model using k-fold cross-validation\n",
    "   b. Compute the average performance metric across all folds\n",
    "3. Select the hyperparameter combination with the best average performance\n",
    "4. Retrain the model on the entire dataset using the best hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Difference between grid search CV and randomized search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search CV:\n",
    "- Exhaustively searches through all possible combinations of hyperparameters\n",
    "- Guaranteed to find the best combination within the defined grid\n",
    "- Can be computationally expensive for large hyperparameter spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "- Randomly samples hyperparameter combinations from the defined space\n",
    "- May not explore all possible combinations\n",
    "- Often more efficient for large hyperparameter spaces\n",
    "- Can find a good solution faster, especially with a large number of hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "When to choose:\n",
    "- Use Grid Search CV when:\n",
    "  1. You have a small number of hyperparameters\n",
    "  2. You have computational resources to explore all combinations\n",
    "  3. You need to guarantee finding the best combination within the grid\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Randomized Search CV when:\n",
    "  1. You have a large number of hyperparameters\n",
    "  2. You have limited computational resources\n",
    "  3. You want to explore a wider range of values in less time\n",

    "Q3. Data leakage and why it's a problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates and poor generalization.\n",

    "1. It gives an unrealistic assessment of model performance\n",

    "Example:\n",

    "   - Ensure features don't contain information from after the prediction time\n",

    "6. Proper handling of missing data:\n",
    "   - Impute missing values within cross-validation, not on the entire dataset\n",
