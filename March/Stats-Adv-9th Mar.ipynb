    "Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are mathematical functions used in probability theory and statistics to describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random variable.\n",

    "Probability Mass Function (PMF): This is applicable to discrete random variables. The PMF gives the probability of a discrete random variable taking on a particular value. Mathematically, for a discrete random variable X, the PMF is denoted by P(X=x), where x is a specific value that X can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF for the outcome of rolling the die is P(X=1) = 1/6, P(X=2) = 1/6, ..., P(X=6) = 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF): This is applicable to continuous random variables. The PDF represents the likelihood of a continuous random variable falling within a particular range. It is denoted by f(x), and the probability of the variable falling in the interval [a, b] is given by the integral of the PDF over that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The standard normal distribution has a PDF given by the bell-shaped curve formula f(x) = (1/(sqrt(2*pi)))*e^(-x^2/2), where x is a real number. Here, f(x) doesn't represent the probability at a specific point but rather the probability density over an interval."

    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) describes the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given point.
