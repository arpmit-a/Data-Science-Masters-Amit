    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularized regression method that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties. Its key characteristics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Objective function: Minimizes the sum of squared residuals + λ * (α * L1_penalty + (1-α) * L2_penalty)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regularization: Uses a mix of L1 and L2 penalties, controlled by the mixing parameter α\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature selection: Can perform feature selection like Lasso while also handling correlated predictors like Ridge\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tuning parameters: Has two main parameters - λ (overall regularization strength) and α (mix of L1 and L2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences from other techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "- vs. OLS: Adds regularization to improve generalization and can perform feature selection\n",
    "- vs. Ridge: Can produce sparse models and perform feature selection\n",
    "- vs. Lasso: Better handles groups of correlated features\n",
    "- vs. Stepwise regression: Provides a more stable and continuous approach to feature selection\n",
