    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression is a linear regression technique that uses L1 regularization. Its key characteristics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Objective function: Minimizes the sum of squared residuals + λ * (sum of absolute values of coefficients)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regularization: Uses L1 penalty, which can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature selection: Performs automatic feature selection by eliminating less important features\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sparse models: Tends to produce simpler models with fewer non-zero coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Bias-variance trade-off: Introduces some bias but reduces variance, often improving generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences from other techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "- vs. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): Lasso adds regularization and can perform feature selection\n",
    "- vs. Ridge Regression: Lasso can produce sparse models, while Ridge only shrinks coefficients\n",

    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to perform automatic feature selection while fitting the model. This is beneficial because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplicity: It combines feature selection and model fitting into a single step\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sparsity: It can produce sparse models by setting some coefficients to exactly zero\n",

    "3. Interpretability: Resulting models are often more interpretable due to fewer features\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Computational efficiency: It can handle high-dimensional data efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Continuous shrinkage: It provides a continuous path for feature selection, unlike stepwise methods\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Stability: It tends to be more stable than stepwise selection methods\n",

    "1. Non-zero coefficients: Features with non-zero coefficients are considered selected and important\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Zero coefficients: Features with coefficients shrunk to zero are considered less important or redundant\n",

    "3. Magnitude: Larger absolute coefficient values suggest stronger predictive power\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sign: The sign indicates the direction of the relationship with the target variable\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scaling: Interpretation depends on whether features were standardized before fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Bias: Coefficients are biased due to the penalty term, so their absolute values are typically smaller than in OLS\n",

    "\n",
    "8. Stability: Consider the stability of coefficients across different samples or lambda values\n",
