    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a regularized version of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function. The key differences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Objective function:\n",
    "   - OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals (SSR)\n",
    "   - Ridge minimizes SSR + Î» * (sum of squared coefficients)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bias-variance trade-off:\n",
    "   - OLS provides unbiased estimates but can have high variance\n",
    "   - Ridge introduces some bias but reduces variance, often leading to better generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multicollinearity handling:\n",
    "   - OLS can be unstable with highly correlated predictors\n",
    "   - Ridge performs well even with multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Coefficient shrinkage:\n",
    "   - OLS doesn't shrink coefficients\n",
    "   - Ridge shrinks all coefficients towards zero, but rarely makes them exactly zero\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Existence of solution:\n",
    "   - OLS can fail when X'X is not invertible\n",
    "   - Ridge always has a solution due to the added penalty term\n",

    "Q2. What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression shares most assumptions with OLS regression, but relaxes some:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between predictors and the response variable should be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence: Observations should be independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of residuals should be constant across all levels of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality of residuals: For inference purposes, residuals should be normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No perfect multicollinearity: Unlike OLS, Ridge can handle high (but not perfect) multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Large sample size relative to the number of predictors: This assumption is relaxed compared to OLS.\n",

    "   - Fitting models with different lambda values\n",
    "   - Choosing the lambda that minimizes the cross-validated error\n",

    "Q4. Can Ridge Regression be used for feature selection? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is not typically used for feature selection because it shrinks coefficients towards zero but rarely makes them exactly zero. However, it can be used for a form of \"soft\" feature selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coefficient magnitude: Features with larger absolute coefficients after Ridge Regression can be considered more important.\n",

    "3. Stability selection: Run Ridge Regression multiple times on subsamples and select features that consistently have non-zero coefficients.\n",

    "4. Threshold method: Set a threshold and consider features with coefficients above this threshold as selected.\n",
